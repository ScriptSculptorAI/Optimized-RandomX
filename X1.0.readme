# Optimized RandomX Assembly Code

## Overview

This repository contains an optimized version of RandomX assembly code specifically designed for cryptocurrency mining. RandomX is a proof-of-work algorithm that aims to be ASIC-resistant, focusing on leveraging the general-purpose CPU's capabilities. This optimization seeks to enhance performance while maintaining the integrity of the RandomX algorithm.

## Features

- **Instruction Reordering:** For better pipelining and potential performance improvements.
- **Reduced Branch Mispredictions:** Some conditional branches have been replaced with branchless constructs where possible to minimize pipeline stalls.
- **SIMD Usage:** Efficient use of SIMD instructions for floating-point operations.
- **Memory Access Optimization:** Ensuring memory operations are aligned for better cache performance.

## Prerequisites

- **x86-64 Architecture:** This code is written for x86-64 processors.
- **Assembler:** You will need an x86-64 assembler like `nasm` or `as` to compile this code.
- **Understanding of RandomX:** Familiarity with the RandomX algorithm will help in understanding and potentially further optimizing this code.

## Usage

### Compiling

To compile this assembly code:

```sh
nasm -f elf64 randomx_optimized.asm -o randomx_optimized.o
ld randomx_optimized.o -o randomx_optimized
