# Optimized RandomX Assembly Code

## Overview

This repository contains optimized assembly code for the RandomX algorithm, tailored for x86-64 CPUs to enhance performance in cryptocurrency mining.

## Features

- **Instruction Scheduling** for better CPU pipelining
- **Branch Prediction Optimization** to reduce stalls
- **SIMD Usage** for enhanced vector operations
- **Memory Access Optimization** for better cache performance

## Prerequisites

- x86-64 compatible CPU
- An assembler like NASM or GNU Assembler (GAS)

## Usage

### Compile

```sh
nasm -f elf64 optimized_randomx.asm -o optimized_randomx.o
ld optimized_randomx.o -o optimized_randomx
```

### Run

Integration into a mining software is required. This code snippet is for testing or direct integration into a mining framework.

## Branches

- **main**: Stable, production-ready code
- **dev**: Development work, pre-release stability
- **feature/**: New features or optimizations
- **hotfix/**: Critical fixes for production issues
- **release/vX.X**: Release preparation branches

## Optimization Details

- Reduced register moves to enhance throughput
- Simplified address calculations for better memory access
- Direct jumps used where possible to minimize branch prediction penalties

## Performance

Performance improvements might vary by hardware. Testing is recommended.
